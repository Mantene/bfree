            <li><b>Definitions</b>
               <ul>
                  <li class="suba"><b>"Collective Work"</b> means a work, such as a periodical 
                  issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in 
                  unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting 
                  separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective
                  whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a 
                  Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
                  <li class="suba"><b>"Derivative Work"</b> means a work based upon the Work or 
                  upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical 
                  arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound 
                  recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in 
                  which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work 
                  that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work 
                  for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work 
                  is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work 
                  in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a 
                  Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
                  <li class="suba"><b>"Licensor"</b> means the individual or entity that offers 
                  the Work under the terms of this License.
                  <li class="suba"><b>"Original Author"</b> means the individual or entity who 
                  created the Work.
                  <li class="suba"><b>"Work"</b> means the copyrightable work of authorship 
                  offered under the terms of this License.
                  <li class="suba"><b>"You"</b> means an individual or entity exercising rights 
                  under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License 
                  with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the 
                  Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
                  <li class="suba"><b>"License Elements"</b> means the following high-level 
                  license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of 
                  this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.

            the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable 
            laws.

            <li><b>License Grant.</b> Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
            Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual 
            (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in 
            the Work as stated below:

                  <li class="suba">to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or 
                  more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the 
                  Collective Works;
                  <li class="suba">to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
                  <li class="suba">to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,

                  the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;

                  perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission 
                  Derivative Works;
                  <li class="suba">The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats 
                  whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right 
                  to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights 
                  in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are 
                  hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 
                  4(e) and 4(f).
               </ul>
            <li><b>Restrictions.</b>  license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made 
            subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
               <ul>
                  <li class="suba">You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or 
                  publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and 
                  You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this 
                  License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly 
                  display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer 
                  or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this 
                  License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You 
                  may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer 
                  to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, 
                  publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work 
                  with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in 
                  a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above 
                  applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not 
                  require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject 
                  to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice 
                  from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the 
                  Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(d), as requested. If You 
                  create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the 
                  extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required 
                  by clause 4(d), as requested.
                  <li class="suba">You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or 
                  publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this 
                  License, a later version of this License with the same License Elements as 
                  this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same 
                  License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 
                  2.5 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier 
                  for, this License or other license specified in the previous sentence with 
                  every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly 
                  display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer 
                  or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms 
                  of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, 
                  and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the 
                  disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly 
                  perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological 
                  measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent 
                  with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative 
                  Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the 
                  Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to 
                  the terms of this License.
                  <li class="suba">You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in 
                  Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed 
                  toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange 
                  of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing 
                  or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward 
                  commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no 
                  payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of 
                  copyrighted works.
                  <li class="suba">If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, 
                  or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective 
                  Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, 
                  reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the 
                  Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if 
                  the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties 
                  (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in 
                  Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, 
                  the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to 
                  the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, 
                  that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does 
                  not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; 
                  and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the 
                  Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original 
                  Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such 
                  credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that 
                  in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit 
                  will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a 
                  manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
                  <li class="suba">For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical 
                  composition:

                        Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually 
                        or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties 
                        for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) 
                        of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed 
                        toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

                        Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually

                        royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") 
                        and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC 
                        Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other 
                        jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily 
                        intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary 
                        compensation.

                  <li class="suba"><b>Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties.</b> For the 
                  avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves 
                  the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights 
                  society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance 
                  (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 
                  17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other 
                  jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily intended 
                  for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
