        <b>bFree </b> is a standalone, cross-platform application that will extract
        the content from a Blackboard&#153; course archive or export "zip" file,
        and create (at a designated location) either a set of folders and data
        or a standalone web site, in either case containing a representation
        of the original Blackboard&#153; course and its content.<br>
        <br>
        Blackboard&#153; course authors use <b>bFree </b> to retrieve their course
        content in simple and standard formats for a variety of uses, including 
        importation into other online systems. </div>
