Using the Web Page Templates

The BflatUnzip web site is generated using a small set of simple
HTML templates. Each template has the basic HTML for the page,
plus a keyword or two indicating where content that is produced
by BflatUnzip should be inserted. The keywords are of the form
"BflatUnzip$xxx$", and each different keyword refers to a different
kind of content.

You may obtain a folder containing these page templates by
clicking the appropriate button in the BflatUnzip window. Then
you can modify or expand the pages to suit your needs or tastes,
being sure to keep the keywords where you would like the content
to be inserted.

The restrictions on your design, if you wish to generate
the web pages using the templates are:

* the templates must keep the names as given
* all the templates must be present
* the "framesets" defined in the index page must remain
* the pages accept only the data indicated by the keywords

Of course, you can extract the content once, then use it in any 
way you please, rather than relying on the templates.
